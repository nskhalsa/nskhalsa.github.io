        <p>One topic I find interesting is the topic of <a href = "https://www.starwars.com/" title = "Star Wars Homepage"><strong>Star Wars.</strong></a> It's interesting how a lot of people seem to have a different favorite <strong>Star Wars</strong> movie and it seems that age is a factor in causing a difference. People who were children when the <strong>Original Trilogy</strong> came out tend to choose one of those three films as their favorite <strong>Star Wars</strong> film while people who were children when the <strong>Prequel Trilogy</strong> came out tend to choose one of those three films as their favorite.</p>
